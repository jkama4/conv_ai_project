About truly early flights, do you know if Airport Inn Express can arrange a taxi or rideshare before 5 am, or should I look at a hotel with 24-hour transport? Also, going back to the earlier point, any decent breakfast spots open early near the terminal so I can grab coffee and a bite before check-out?"

I’ll also identify which breakfast spots near the terminal open before 5 am so I can grab a quick coffee and bite before checkout. <END> bye"
